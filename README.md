## SFRCA Exercise

I build this project as a demonstration of skills during an interview process. It is intended to showcase my abilities as a UX Developer.

### Description

A landing page for the South Carolina Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office. The page includes navigation with links, a dynamic search, and a large dynamic site navigation menu. Below this is a hero component with a search bar. Finally, there is a section with large, pictoral links to important parts of the website. 

I used CSS Modules to organize the styling of this webpage.

This project uses React, Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

### Getting Started

Clone down this repository from github at https://github.com/jesslrobertson/scrfa-exercise

Open the file in your favorite code editor. Run ```npm install``` to get all dependencies.

To start the file, open the terminal, navigate to the project directory, and run ```npm start```


### Further Development - Steps I would take if I had more time:

* I would complete the rest of the page as indicated in the styleguide I was provided. I would attempt to create reusable components as they were relevant, and to keep my code as dry as possible.

* Assuming the rest of the site was live and functional, I would connect all links to their paths, and connect search fields to the relevant API calls.

* I would ask questions of the designer. Specifically, I would ask whether the main menu requires hover and click states over menu items.
